      <p><q>Carbonine are definitely heavy, at times blistering so, but they never come across like a Heavy Metal band. <q>Winter Night</q>, for example, features the sort of shredding in the middle that reminds me of Vernon Reid on <q>Cult of Personality</q>, and as I write that it occurs that the two bands share similarities in the way their heaviness can be hidden but ever present. Mike Godoy has a decent voice that I can imagine doing Pop Punk in another life, and the band behind him throw Metal, Pop and Funk about (some very sweet bass lines from Andrew Bushong) like talented metal patients. The album isnt very heavy on choruses, so can be a bit hard to get into, but the several spins it takes are worth it because theres a very talented, energetic band here. So what we have is a Heavy Metal band thats not really a Heavy Metal band, throwing a smorgasbord of tunes that each have their own delicious flavor.</q>

      <p><q>Ian Rico, he has that George Lynch style, and produces Lynch-esque riffs particularly on the hard rocker <q>Take It All The Way</q>. Vocalist Mike Godoy has that Layne Staley (Alice In Chains) and Brandon Boyd (Incubus) tone and vibrato that really starts to shine through on this record, most notably on the energetic <q>Broken</q> Bassist Andrew Bushong (since replaced by Mitchell Wolkow) has a very prominent sound and the hard, modern, mid-tempo rocker and first single <q>Say I Am</q> features his bass-led styling with hints of A.I.C. in the heavy rhythm, as well as stamping his authority all over the slower similar A.I.C.-sounding <q>Bury My Shame</q>. Drummer Alex Ascha is very solid throughout and has a non-showy hard hitting style that drives the band. Last but by no means least mention must go to <q>Edge Of The World</q> with its Saigon Kick-esque riffs powering this song along and the rhythmically thundering <q>Thoughts</q> with its solid opening staccato riffs.</q>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p><q>What they are is a fairly traditional heavy rock band, with a few nu-metal influences which they, thankfully, keep to a minimum. Mike Godoy, Ian Rico, Alex Ascha and Mitchell Wolkowo (although its former bassist Andrew Bushong on the CD) certainly know how to bash out a good tune, some of which seem very Dokken like in nature (ask your Dad). They really are good on hard-edged songs like <q>Take It All The Way</q>, but manage to impress on a power ballad as well. Not something many bands can pull off but <q>Will You Love Me Tomorrow</q> really works well. At times they head off into Alice In Chains territory and my interest flags slightly, but even then there is more than enough to suggest that Carbonine could develop into something very good indeed.
